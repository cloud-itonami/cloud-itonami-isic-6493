(ns factoring.operation
  "OperationActor -- one factoring operation = one supervised actor
  run, expressed as a langgraph-clj StateGraph. The advisor
  (Factoring-LLM) is sealed into a single node (:advise); its proposal
  is ALWAYS routed through the Factoring Governor (:govern) and the
  rollout phase gate (:decide) before anything commits to the SSoT.

  Everything the actor depends on is injected, so each is a swap, not a
  rewrite:
    - the Store    (MemStore today; Datomic/kotoba-server is the next seam) - `store` arg
    - the Advisor  (mock | real LLM)                                       - :advisor opt
    - the Phase    (0->3 rollout)                                          - :phase in ctx

  One graph run = one factoring operation (intake -> advise -> govern
  -> decide -> commit | hold | approval). No unbounded inner loop --
  each operation is auditable and checkpointed.

  Human-in-the-loop = real approval workflow:
  `interrupt-before #{:request-approval}` pauses the actor and hands the
  decision to a human operator (the licensed factor). The approver
  resumes with `{:approval {:status :approved}}` (or :rejected).
  `:advance/fund`/`:reserve/settle`/`:solvency/attest` ALWAYS reach
  this node when the governor is clean -- see `factoring.phase`."
